# DeCarbTracker

Overview

This project is a specialized blockchain-based platform for carbon impact accounting, specifically tailored for submission in the ETHGlobal Hackathon under the UNICEF track. The platform utilizes Ethereum blockchain technology, smart contracts, and various Web3 tools to provide a transparent, immutable, and verifiable system for recording and verifying carbon emissions and reductions.

Objectives

Utilize Ethereum Blockchain: Leverage Ethereum's robust network for decentralized and secure data handling.
Smart Contract Automation: Implement smart contracts for automatic verification and validation of carbon data.
Integrate Web3 Technologies: Use Web3 tools for seamless user interaction with the blockchain.
Key Features

Ethereum Blockchain: Use Ethereum for its widespread adoption, security, and support for complex smart contracts.
ERC-20 Carbon Tokens: Implement ERC-20 tokens to represent carbon credits, enabling trade and tracking.
Decentralized Data Storage: Use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage of detailed carbon data.
Oracles for Real-Time Data: Integrate oracles to fetch real-time environmental data from external sources.
Technical Architecture

Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity, these contracts handle data validation, token generation, and transaction processing.
Frontend Interface: A React-based web application interfaced with MetaMask for user interaction with Ethereum blockchain.
Data Integration: Use Chainlink oracles for external data and integrate with IoT devices for emission tracking.
Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions: Implement Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism or Arbitrum for enhanced transaction throughput and reduced gas fees.
Implementation Phases

Phase 1 - Prototype on Testnet: Develop a prototype on Ethereum's Rinkeby or Ropsten testnet.
Phase 2 - Pilot with Layer 2 Integration: Run pilot projects on Layer 2 networks to ensure scalability.
Phase 3 - Full-Scale Mainnet Launch: Deploy the platform on the Ethereum mainnet after comprehensive testing.
Impact Measurement

On-Chain Analytics: Utilize blockchain explorers and analytics tools to monitor token transactions and smart contract interactions.
User Feedback and Surveys: Regularly gather user feedback for improvements and measure satisfaction.
Challenges and Solutions

Gas Fees and Scalability: Implement Layer 2 solutions to mitigate high gas fees and scalability issues of Ethereum.
Data Veracity: Employ strict smart contract protocols and external audits to ensure data accuracy.
Sustainability and Future Roadmap

DAO for Governance: Establish a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for platform governance and updates.
Cross-Chain Compatibility: Explore interoperability with other blockchains for wider adoption.
Regular Updates and Community Engagement: Maintain an active development cycle and community involvement for continuous improvement.
Conclusion

This Ethereum-based carbon accounting platform for the ETHGlobal Hackathon represents a groundbreaking approach to environmental accountability, blending cutting-edge blockchain technology with the need for transparent and verifiable carbon impact tracking. It's an ambitious project that not only aligns with UNICEF's sustainability goals but also pushes the envelope in blockchain application for social good.
